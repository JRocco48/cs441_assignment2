Imagine 2048 but with NEGATIVE NUMBERS! 

The goal of Stay Positive is to ... yes ... stay positive. Create the largest POSITIVE value you can.
Values of +1 or -1 will spawn at random, it is your job to tediously work to cancel out the negatives and grow your positivity!
This game is very, very frustrating, and I feel that it is an ironic commentary on what it takes in our own lives to stay positive.
Enjoy 8^)
